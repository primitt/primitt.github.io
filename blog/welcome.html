            Hey guys! Welcome to my website! After spending a while on this, I have finally... finished it (mostly). I used <a href="https://bulma.io"><strong>BulmaCSS</strong></a> to create this website. I want to thank a few people for inspiring me
            to, well, <strong>code</strong>. When I was younger, my parents enrolled me into a coding class. I did not like it so much at the time. Fast forward 5 or 6 years later, my interest of code grows. I got into crypto-currency in early 2021. I
            have no idea what inspired me to start, but i started. My parents did not know I was into crypto until I told them of its potential! They said "cool", and went on their way.
            <br> But, im starting to rant. Anyways, my coding really sparked when I joined <a href="https://duinocoin.com"><strong>duino-coin</strong></a>. Duino-Coin had an amazing team. I loved the project and by being active, I was promoted to a social
            manager. Cool right? I met the team, and learned a lot from them. My thanks go to:

            <br> I hope to continue coding and build my career on this.
            <br> Thanks and have a wonderful day!
